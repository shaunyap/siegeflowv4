Moving from WordPress to Gatsby turned out to be a much easier decision than I had initially expected. I've had a good professional run doing custom WordPress builds, but the writing has been on the wall for a good while. 

Most of my development stack is now JavaScript-based, and I've been working on more sophisticated projects. Plus, I love [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). So started me down a journey for a new backend for siegeflow.com. That's when I found [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Gatsby is an Open-Sourced React site generator that purportedly builds fast, secure and performant websites.
